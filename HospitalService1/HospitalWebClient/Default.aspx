            <h2>Hospital's Functionality</h2>
            <p>
                Hospitals are only an intermediate stage of civilization, never intended at all even to take in the whole sick population. <br />
                The hospital that feeds you refined sugar, white bread, canned soup, bouillon cubes, and frozen vegetables should be closed by the health department as a menace to the public health. <br />
                Hospitals are great places, and you can learn from them, but you don't necessarily need to go in anytime you get the sniffles. And maybe you shouldn't treat pregnancy as a disease. <br />
